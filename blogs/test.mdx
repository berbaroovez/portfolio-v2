Yo fren! Im going to show ya'll how to make a mdx based nextjs blog just like this one. I'll guide you through it and talk about my troubles.
Hope this helps you!! I'll be using hashnodes [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) for this build

<br />

I'm hosting my mdx files in my project and not in a database.
First thing you need to do is create a directory in your project for your mdx files, I called my blogs and put this [test mdx file](https://gist.github.com/thapakazi/da3aede9dd57900c30e0c7a01b3e8329) in there. So
we have somethign we can render when testing. Feel free to duplicate this file and change the title and slug for better testing. after doing that create a directory in the pages folder and name it blogs.
Place a file into called [slug].js/tsx deping on if your using typescript or javascript. The "slug" part of the file can be anything you want but you have to make sure you pass in the same word later on in getStaticPaths. I'll explain more down below.

### Gray Matter

Gray matter is a package that allows you to read the Front-Matter (metadata) from a markdown file. Adding metadata to a markdown file is down by putting a pair of "---" dashes at the top of your file think of it almost like a block comment. So you will put all you metadata in between the pairs in the following foramat.
Key: Value for example: Slug: mdx-blog or Author: Carter. It is up to you to put the metadata you want in this section I just stuck with slug, author, and title for now.

### Get Static Paths

Since we will be building our blog at buildtime we will need a way to grab all the paths to blog posts. We do this by getting all the files in the blog post directory and then filtering out the information to get our slug.
