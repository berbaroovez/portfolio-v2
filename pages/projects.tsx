        <p>
          Live streamer Nathan Stanz had been watching a old british show called{" "}
          <span>Task Master </span> on stream and wanted to put on his own
          version of this show for his community. He wanted a website to create
          weekly task that his audience would have to complete and submit for
          points.
        </p>
        <p>
          App was built on a stack of NextJS, styled-components, and supabase.
          The host or moderators could create "Events" that contained tasks
          which were then published to user dashboards. Users could then upload
          their attempts and on the backend the moderators/host could view
          submissions and assign points to the users.

        <p>
          This was my first ever internship. I joined a team who had previously
          created a health wellness checker for private schools for covid
          related questions. Following their success, they wanted to create an
          web app that allowed students to upload their vaccine card to prove
          their vaccination status.
        </p>

        <p>
          This projects main goal was making sure we had everything encrypted.
          We used a service provided by a company called Virgil Security to do
          end to end encryption. The site was built using NextJS and hosted on
          Vercel for easy deployments. My duties included doing a majority of
          the front end work, and ensuring the encryption was working.
        </p>

        <p>
          I learned a lot from this project especially since it was my first
          project with a team and that had a paying customer. I had to decrease
          loading times on the admin dashboard by 90% by not decrypting the
          photos until the were shown. Adding features such as exporting data
          via CSV or adding the ability to create a safelist of allowed emails
          that could sign up.

        <ProjectTitle>Cat Ears for V1</ProjectTitle>
        <p>
          V1 stands for version 1 an north american esports team. In the summer
          of 2021 their valorant team advanced to the first ever LAN for the
          game valorant. As one of underdog teams they came in and won their
          first game with their star player wearing cat ears on his headset.
          Thinking quickly i launched a website where people can upload photos
          and add cat eats to it then download it. I then tweeted at the
          org/posted in their discord.
        </p>

        <p>
          I woke up the following morning to the org posting my website on their
          main{" "}

          </a>{" "}
          account. . They also launched a hashtag along with it. sooner then
          later twitter profile photos were popping up with cat ears left and
          right. The website got over 3k hits in the first day. Still one of the
          coolest things ive ever built.{" "}

        <p>
          <a href="https://www.formsummary.com/"> Form Summary </a>, this was a
          simple website made for my mother who does custom sugar cookies. A few
          times a year she does cookie drops and needed a better way to fulfil
          orders. Created a simple website that allow her to upload her
          spreadsheet and see the info in separate cards. First time storing
          data in local storage allowing for the website to be closed and
          reopened to the same info.

          <a href="https://drinkcacti.vercel.app/"> Cacti </a>, This was just a
          remake of the website used to launch the seltzer brand cacti. I was
          practicing styling and this website seemed unique and simple enough to
          copy.

          <a href="https://cookiecrumbs.vercel.app/"> Cookie Crumbs </a> . Oh
          boy this project taught me a lot and i failed a ton. it was an attempt
          to create an one stop shop for my moms cookie business. ordering
          forms, a backend to accept/deny orders, an order tracker to see what
          stage a order was in, and even a payment system to accept payments.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was my first major project that had a real world goal in mind. I
          learned a lot about when to use server side rendering vs client side
          rendering with NextJS. The difficulty of creating a order form that
          worked for multiple people. I even attempted at creating a form maker
          which i failed at.
        </p>
        <p>
          overall, im proud of this project. I had lots of ambitions and learned
          my limits of my programming knowledge. in the end it failed and i
          never launched it but i learned database design, getting feedback from
          a client, and much more.
