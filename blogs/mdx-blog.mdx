Yo fren! Im going to show ya'll how to make an mdx based nextjs blog just like
this one. I'll guide you through it and talk about my troubles. Hope this helps
you!! I'll be using hashnodes
[next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) for this build.

<br />

I'm hosting my mdx files in my project and not in a database. Before we start
set up a nextjs project any way you want I used my
[boilerplate](https://github.com/berbaroovez/sc-next-boilerplate) but you could
also use yarn create next-app. First thing you need to do is create a directory
in your project for your mdx files, I called my blogs and put this
[test mdx file](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/thapakazi/da3aede9dd57900c30e0c7a01b3e8329/raw/1a3378c27d2c15a5495f8adb6ddc1c2b0a7f4548/sample.md)
in there. So we have something we can render when testing. Feel free to
duplicate this file and change the title and slug for better testing. after
doing that create a directory in the pages folder and name it blogs. Place a
file into it called [slug].js/tsx depending on if your using typescript or
javascript. The "slug" part of the file can be anything you want but you have to
make sure you pass in the same word later on in getStaticPaths. I'll explain
more down below. The [] is a catch all that will allow us to create a template
file for each blog post.

<br />

### Gray Matter

You might of notice at the top of the test file there is some extra data in it
thats called Front-Matter (metadata). Gray matter is a package that allows you
to read the Front-Matter from a markdown file. Adding metadata to a markdown
file is down by putting a pair of "---" dashes at the top of your file think of
it almost like a block comment. So you will put all you metadata in between the
pairs in the following format. Key: Value for example: Slug: mdx-blog or Author:
Carter. It is up to you to put the metadata you want in this section I just
stuck with slug, author, and title for now.For this project I put the following
things in the Front-Matter: by, date, title, and slug.

### Get Static Paths

Since we will be building our blog at build time we will need a way to grab all
the paths to blog posts. We do this by getting all the files in the blog post
directory and then filtering out the information to get our slug. The slug will
be part of the url for example on my site that looks like this:
cartols.com/blog/slug. Notice that in the params object we are only returning
the slug. This is because we named the file [slug] so we must return the same
name in the params object.

<CodeBlock text={"mdx_blog"} language="jsx" />

### Get Static Props

In getting the static paths we get the context object from getStaticPaths but a
caveat is that context only contains the slug. You cannot pass any other data
directly in. This means we have to grab the file information again for each
slug. This time its more direct. We do not have to use a for loop we just grab
the file directly since on my website the slug is also the file name. If you do
not want this and want to name your files differently from the slugs you will
have to repeat something like above where you use a for loop and check if file
to see which one matches the grey matter info. We get all the information and
pass it as a prop into the component.

<CodeBlock text={"mdx_blog_getStaticProps"} language="jsx" />

### Rendering

My main component is extremely simple. All I do is set the header to the title
from the props and then pass the blog content into a next-mdx-remote component.
This component takes the data from the mdx file and renders it to html. You can
expand this component to add SEO related information to your blog posts or even
a header image. The options are pretty much endless. That also means you can add
as much info in your grey matter as you want. Notice though that for MDXRemote
you have to pass in the custom components you will be using. So below you see I
pass in my CodeBlock component in a object. If I was using more components I
would just add them to the object.

<CodeBlock text={"mdx_blog_BlogComponent"} language="jsx" />

<br />

### MDX file

We are using mdx because it allows us to pass in custom components to our blog
post such as these code blocks.

<CodeBlock text={"mdx_blog_mdx_example"} language="text" />

<br />
This code block just takes in the code and renders it using a library called react-code-blocks.
You can check out the code in the [repo here](https://github.com/berbaroovez/portfolio-v2/blob/main/components/BlogStuff/CodeBlock.tsx).
The nice thing about mdx is that these components can literally be anything you can
even wrap some of the text in a component to have to display styling. Its really
easy to use and makes creating blog posts really easy.{" "}
