<span>This is more a self note to myself then a blog post</span>

Since taking Lee Robinsons course I've been using some sort of useAuth hook in
my firebase related projects. Lee's course unfortunately is only in javascript
so I've had to use that version in my typescript projects until recently when I
finally went through and typed it

<br />
<br />

## Basics

I'm wrapping my entire project in a Context Provider that is provided with a few
values. Right now those values are an auth object containing information about
the user, a sign in function, a sign up function, and a sign out function. Any
function/variables could be passed to this

<br />
<br />

## Context notes

In a normal useContext situation that doesnt use custom hooks the set up looks
like this.

1. const Context = createContext(`<`default values`>`)

2. Wrapping the app in provider `<`Context.Provider
   value=`{<values>}>`{children} `<`/Context.Provider`>`

3. then when you wanted to grab a value from with in the app you would use the
   useContext hook. const value = useContext(Context)

if you dont use the "useContext" hook you must wrap your componant in a consumer
component such as `<`Context.Consumer`>`{children}`<`/Context.Consumer`>` if you
use the consumer you can just get the values using {value} but with the
useContext hook you get your values by value = useContext(`<`variable from
createContext`>`)

<br />
<br />

## Custom hooks

### Check List

1. use "createContext" to create the context
2. create an "AuthProvider" component that passes are values to the context
   provider. This wraps the entire project
3. create the custom hook "useAuth" all this does is return
   "useContext(context)" the context is got from step 1.
4. create the main function that will return all of values and store the
   functions we are sharing
   <br />
   <br />

## Creating Context

To create context we use the function "createContext".

<CodeBlock text={"use_auth_createContext"} language={"jsx"} />
In a non typescript project you can get away with not putting in the default value
in createContext but typescript will yell at you. So that means we need to come up
with types.{" "}

So our default value will need to be of this types it looks like this

<CodeBlock text={"use_auth_defaultTypes"} language={"jsx"} />

Next Up is the our custom Provider function instead of wrapping the app in
authContext.Provider we create a custom component this will supply the auth
object to all children

<CodeBlock text={"use_auth_AuthProvider"} language="jsx" />

After that we have the custom hook that the children object will use instead of
calling useContext anytime they want access to the auth value

<CodeBlock text={"use_auth_useAuth"} language="jsx" />

And the final part of the the file is the function that creates the auth object
and controls state This can have any number of functions passed to it and I'm
cutting out a lot of info for the sake of space but I'll leave one function and
one variable

<CodeBlock text={"use_auth_AuthObjectFunction"} language="jsx" />
<br />
And with that we have a fully typed and working useAuth hook that works for
firebase and can be easily switched out with something like supabase
